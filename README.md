# My Dotfiles

This repository contains the configuration files (dotfiles) I use to set up and manage my development environment across various systems. 

## Managing Dotfiles with Chezmoi

I use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage my dotfiles. Chezmoi helps to securely and easily manage configuration files across multiple devices, and simplifies the process of keeping them synchronized.
